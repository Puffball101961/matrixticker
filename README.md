# RGB Matrix Ticker
RGB Matrix Crypto and Stock Ticker based on a Raspberry Pi
Uses a Raspberry Pi 3A+, 2 32x64 RGB matrices to form a 32x128 display, connected to the Pi with the Adafruit RGB Matrix HAT with RTC.

# Development Temporarily Paused
Little to no updates will be pushed during this time due to studying for VCE exams. Expect development to resume December 2023/January 2024

A (nearly) complete rewrite is in progress! The new code architecture will be a lot more modular, allowing for much easier custom additions to the ticker.
Features expected to come with (or soon after) this update include:
- ~~Modules~~ Implemented!
- Web UI
- And More!

## Features planned
- Stocks
- Commodities
- Weather
- News

## Adding more symbols
I am planning on automating this process soon.
To add more functionality, do the following:

**Crypto Module:**\
1: Find the crypto you want to add on Coingecko, and locate it's API ID\
2: Add the CoinGecko ID to the configv2.yml file\
3 (Optional): Add an icon with maximum height of 32px (doesn't have to be square) into icons/crypto, with the same name as the CoinGecko ID

## Contributing
I will be welcoming and encouraging improvements and extra features to the code. If you want to add your own module or fix one of mine, make a PR!
If you want to add an icon for a crypto, make a PR!
