RGB Matrix Crypto and Stock Ticker based on a Raspberry Pi

I'm not a pro 3d modeller or programmer so pls don't attack me :)
This project was a part of hackclub.com 's Winter Hardware Wonderland Program.

This Project is not 100% complete, and is not foolproof. You will need some knowledge and common sense to get it working.
I am planning to refine the process when I have time to work on it.
